            Problem
        </h1>
        <p>
            Nowadays, people have become more aware of the need to live a sustainable life. 
            They have been bringing glass containers to work, using tumblers for morning coffee, 
            and taking public transportation to avoid driving. However, developing sustainable habits 
            alone is never an easy task. We found from 10 interviews that people often feel helpless, 
            lonely, and unmotivated during the process. In this paper, we present a mobile app CHANGE 
            that gamifies habit-forming experience. CHANGE provides structured steps with informative 
            tips to help users achieve personal goals, visualizes their achievements in journey maps, 
            and motivates them through team challenges that bring in communities to support users through 
            their journeys.

            Solution
        </h1>
        <h2 class="feature">Local map: connect local users to form a community</h2>
        <p>
            With CHANGE, we build a local map to help users to connect to other users, 
            so as to create a sense of belonging. Also, from our user research, we know 
            that users are greatly influenced by the environment and the community, so we try 
            to build this app with a map that can help users to find nearby like-minded people 
            who are also interested in cultivating sustainable habits.
        </p>

        <h2 class="feature">
            Personal challenge: rewards and reflection to internalize sustainable habits
        </h2>
        <p>
            Apart from group challenges, we also create the section for solo-challenge-takers. 
            In personal challenges, we focus on reflection through self-rating and assessment. 
            Also, to incentivize users, we provide small real-ward rewards to motivate them so that they 
            know their reflection with CHANGE is greatly connected to their daily life.
        </p>
        <h2 class="feature">
            Group challenge: increase motivation by the sense of collaboration and competition
        </h2>
        <p>
            To increase the sense of community, we want to elevate the process of forming sustainable 
            habits to a crowdsourcing game to not only motivate users to contribute to sustainable actions 
            but also make them feel a sense of honor.
